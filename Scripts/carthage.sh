# carhage caching by Joe Mattiello

# Inspired from http://shashikantjagtap.net/cache-carthage-speed-ios-continuous-integration/

#
# The purpose of this script is to reduce the amount of checkouts Carthage runs.
# I use this script in an XCode 'run script' build phase as the first phase before compiling
# If you have mutliple targets, projects, frameworks etc, you can include this script in each and it will selec
# the correct Carthage folder for each target.
#
# There's also an optional fastlane integration if it's installed.
# For my project we make fastlane optional, this script will choose which ever is availabe.
# An example Fastfile will be included with this gist.
#
# Usage:
#  $ ./carthage.sh platform
# * platform: Cant be a single platform, 'tvOS', or command seperated multiples, 'tvOS,iOS'

# If  not online, we just quit successfully.
# If the user hasn't bootstap'd carthage locally they will most likely get a build error next.
